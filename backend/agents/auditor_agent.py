"""
Security & Strategy Auditor Agent
The "Trusted Teammate" - Reviews high-stakes actions before execution
Implements "Cross-Agent Vibe-Checking" for safe autonomous operations

This agent acts as a peer-reviewer, assessing:
1. Intent Alignment - Is this aligned with user's long-term goals?
2. PII/Safety Check - Is private information being leaked?
3. Conflict Resolution - Does this conflict with previous actions?
4. Risk Assessment - What's the downside if this goes wrong?
5. Alternative Validation - Are there safer alternatives?
